ðŸ’¡ Basically, it is a website that aims to improve the understanding of how create enthusiastic layouts,
with focus at the property "position" from CSS.
It's a bit different from what is usually used to create websites layout (with flexboix, float, grid layout).
The design was made internally on Figma and implemented with the following tools/technologies:

- HTML5
- JSES6+
- SCSS (https://sass-lang.com/)
- GSAP (https://greensock.com/)
- Figma (UI Design) (https://figma.com/)

## ðŸ›  Install

Windows, MacOs or Linux: It's a pure HTML, CSS and JS project, just open
the project with some code editor and open through a simple server
like VsCode's LiveServer.

## ðŸ“ˆ Implementation of the project

## ðŸ’» Dev env setup

As it is a website made with native technologies supported by browsers,
No configuration is required to run the project. Just open it
in a code editor and a simple server. I recommend using VSCode and
install the "Live Server" extension (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to create a local server and have the reloading functionality when saving the project.
